2.2 Bridge Pattern

- Situations where we want to separate an abstraction (e.g., an interface or an
algorithm) from how it is implemented.

- With the Bridge Pattern the approach is to create wto independent class
hierarchies: the "abstract" one defining the operations and the concrete one
providing the implementations that the abstract operations will ultimately
call.

2.4 Decorator Pattern

In general, a decorator is a function that takes a function as its sole
argument and returns a new function with the same name as the original function
but with enhanced functionality.

* The Decorator Pattern is so useful that Python has built-in support for it.
* It can be applied to both functions and methods.
* Python supports class decorators: functions that take a class as their sole
  argument and that return a new class with the same name as the original class
  but with additional functionality.

- A decorator may accept only a singl function, method, or class as its sole
argument, so in theory it isn't possible to parameterize decorators.
- Perfectly possible to stack decorators

Structure:
    1. create a wrapper function. Inside it call the original function.
    2. Do any preprocessing before the call;
    3. Do any postprocessing after the call;
    4. Return whatever you like (original/modified result, whatever).
    5. Return the wrapper function as the decorator's result

2.5 Facade

The Facade Pattern is used to present a simplified and uniform interface to a
subsystem whose interface is too comple or too low-level for convenient use.

Bound and Unbound methods:
A *bound* method is a method that is already associated with an instance of its
class.
An *unbound* method is a method with no associated instance.
- Strictly speaking, Python3 doesn't acutally have unbound methods, so unbound
is really the underlying function object, although this only makes a difference
in some metaprogramming corner cases.
