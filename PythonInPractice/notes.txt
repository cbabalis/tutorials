2.2 Bridge Pattern

- Situations where we want to separate an abstraction (e.g., an interface or an
algorithm) from how it is implemented.

- With the Bridge Pattern the approach is to create wto independent class
hierarchies: the "abstract" one defining the operations and the concrete one
providing the implementations that the abstract operations will ultimately
call.
