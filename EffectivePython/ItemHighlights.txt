Lists:

Don't be verbose
    - no 0 for the start index
    - no length for the end index

Slicing is forgiving of start or end indexes.

Having two lists, assigning to a list slice will replace that range in the
original sequence (even if lengths are different).

#6
Use positive stride values in slices WITHOUT start/end indexes.
Avoid negative stride values.

Avoid using start, end and stride together in a slingle slice.

#7
Prefer list comprehensions than "map" and "filter" built-in functions

Dictionaries also support comprehension expressions.
